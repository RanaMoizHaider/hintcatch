## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Laravel 12
- **Frontend**: Livewire 3 + Volt
- **UI Components**: Flux (free components)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: SQLite (configurable)
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Development Environment**: Laravel Herd

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer
- Node.js & npm
- [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) (recommended for local development)

## Installation

### Quick Setup with Herd

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RanaMoizHaider/hintcatch.git
   cd hintcatch
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Configure database**
   
   The project is pre-configured to use SQLite. The database file will be created automatically when you run migrations.

6. **Run migrations and seed data**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate --seed
   ```

7. **Build assets**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

8. **Start the development server**
   
   If using Herd, the site should be accessible at `http://hintcatch.test` automatically.
   
   Otherwise, run:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

### Manual Setup (without Herd)

If you're not using Herd, you can set up the project manually:

1. Follow steps 1-7 from the Herd setup
2. Configure your web server to point to the `public` directory
3. Make sure the `storage` and `bootstrap/cache` directories are writable

## Development

### Asset Development

Start the Vite development server for hot reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test
```

or with Pest:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pest
```

### Code Formatting

Format your code with Laravel Pint:

```bash
./vendor/bin/pint
```

## Database Structure

The application includes several key models:

- **Users** - User accounts and profiles
- **Prompts** - The core prompt content with metadata
- **Categories** - Hierarchical categorization system
- **Platforms** - AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **Providers** - AI service providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **AiModels** - Specific AI models (GPT-4, Claude 3.5, etc.)
- **Comments** & **Likes** - Social interaction features

### Key Relationships

- Prompts belong to Users and Categories
- Prompts can be associated with multiple AI Models and Platforms
- AI Models belong to Providers
- Categories support nested hierarchies
- Tagging system using Spatie Laravel Tags

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started:

### Setting Up for Development

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`
3. Follow the installation steps above
4. Make your changes
5. Write/update tests as needed
6. Ensure code style compliance: `./vendor/bin/pint`

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
APP_NAME="Hint Catch"
APP_ENV=local
APP_KEY=                 # Generated with php artisan key:generate
APP_DEBUG=true
APP_URL=http://localhost

# Database (SQLite by default)
DB_CONNECTION=sqlite

# Session
SESSION_DRIVER=database

# Queue (database by default)
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database

# Cache
CACHE_STORE=database
```

### Optional Configuration

- **Redis**: Set up Redis for improved caching and sessions
- **File Storage**: Configure cloud storage for file uploads

## Deployment

### Production Checklist

1. Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false`
2. Configure a production database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
3. Set up proper caching: `php artisan config:cache`

### Deployment Commands

```bash
# Optimize for production
php artisan optimize
php artisan view:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan config:cache

# Run migrations
php artisan migrate --force

# Build assets
npm run build
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Permission Issues**: Ensure `storage/` and `bootstrap/cache/` are writable
2. **Asset Issues**: Run `npm run build` if styles/scripts aren't loading
3. **Database Issues**: Verify the SQLite file exists and is writable
4. **Livewire Issues**: Clear browser cache and run `php artisan livewire:discover`
